  "Consider the provided files as templates and student submissions for an assignment. Analyze the code and give each file a grade from 0 to 10. If the code is not perfect but works, just give a 10. If there are critical flaws, reduce the grade according to the severity. For each submission, just give an overall grade and output a brief summary of issues only when the grade is deducted. Do not output positive feedback. Disregard anything related to comments or documentation. In the end, output the total grade for the submission, which is the average of the grades for each file. If there are submissions unrelated to an assignment, simply ignore them.";
